Kickbox
=======
This is v0.01 (initial alpha) of Kickbox - a project to map automatically between .NET and Knockout ViewModels. There are also helper functions to send/receive Json data to/from an MVC controller.

It is implemented using intuitive Razor syntax. For example, instead of @Html.TextBox, use @Ajax.TextBox and the HTML will be automatically rendered using the data-bind="..." attribute.

More docs coming soon, as well as next phase of implementation.
